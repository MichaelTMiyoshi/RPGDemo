RPG Demonstration Project

This RPG Demonstration Project is one of the companion repositories for my book <a href="https://amzn.to/3bQuePT" target="_blank"><i>C++ with Miyoshi</i></a>.  This is one of the first repositories that I ever created, which is why the Visual Studio solution file (.sln) is located right here with the README file.  (I may come back and fix that one day.)

There is a progression of the code which you can follow if you look at the different branches in sequence.  (I was not planning on having this as a repo for my book, but after looking at it, I think I will.  If I had thought about it beforehand, I would have put numbers on the branches so that they would appear in chronological order instead of alphabetical order after master.)  The branches are listed in chronological order below:

1.  variables
1.  gameLoop
1.  functions
1.  struct
1.  vector

At the time of this writing, I did not add code for file reading and writing.

My suggestion for using this repository is to look at the branches in chronological order.  Especially, if you are reading my book and just want to use this repository for its intended purpose, which is to give you an example of what the RPG might look like on a tiny scale.  If you look at the master branch when you are just starting to program, you will wonder what all the gibberish is.  But if you have done a HELLO WORLD program (the first program you write in every coding language you learn) and figured out a little bit about variables and constants, you can look at the code in the variables branch and understand it.  This is true all the way through the chronology.  (I noticed that I do not have a branching branch.  But there is plenty of branching in the gameLoop branch.)
